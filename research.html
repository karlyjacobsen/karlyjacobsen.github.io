  <p class="kjstyle"> I formulate and analyze
  mathematical models of biological processes in order to understand
  behavior, reveal correlations and predict success of interventions.  In doing so, I also pursue questions of mathematical
  interest in areas such as applied dynamical systems, differential
  equations, stochastic processes, linear algebra, graph theory and
  statistics.  My primary interest is the study of infectious diseases
  on networks. </p>

  The homogeneous mixing assumption upon which many
  epidemiological models are based fails to account for population-level
  heterogeneities, such as host- and space-dependent transmissibility and
  connectivity, which can critically impact disease spread.  We consider a stochastic SIR-type epidemic on a contact network with a
  specified degree distribution. We determine a sufficient condition
  on the degree distribution under which a well-known pair approximation model
  gives the exact large graph limit of the stochastic process.  Based
  on this result, we formulate a hybrid stochastic-deterministic model
  which allows for Bayesian parameter estimation while remaining
  computationally inexpensive.  We extend this framework to dynamic
  multi-layer graphs where layers correspond to different interaction
  types.  A key aspect of the work is that contact patterns changes in
  response to infection. 
  <!--Ongoing work includes formal proofs of a law
  of large numbers and central limit theorem, analysis of the limiting
ODE system, parameter identifiability, and fitting to Ebola data.  In addition, we plan to investigate control methods (e.g. vaccination, distribution of personal protective equipment) in which our multitype dynamic graph framework may reveal interesting tradeoffs in terms of optimal strategies.-->    <br></p><br>
  
<a name = "ebola"></a>
<p class="subtitle">Ebola</p>
<p class="kjstyle">
Our primary application is Ebola
for which we consider a two-layer graph with contact types corresponding to regular community
contacts and healthcare contacts, features relevant
for Ebola given the disproportionate Ebola risk experienced by
healthcare workers and caregivers in the recent West Africa outbreak.  We are working in collaboration
with the Kinshasa School of Public Health and the Ministry of Health
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Ongoing work includes formal proofs of a law
  of large numbers and central limit theorem, analysis of the limiting
ODE system, parameter identifiability, and fitting to Ebola data.  In addition, we plan to investigate control methods (e.g. vaccination, distribution of personal protective equipment) in which our multitype dynamic graph framework may reveal interesting tradeoffs in terms of optimal strategies.
<!--While the DRC outbreaks are on a much smaller scale than the 2014 West Africa outbreak, the dataset is of high quality, providing detailed patient histories and contact tracing information which is critical for parameter identifiability.  Based on data from the 2014 outbreak, we have developed statistical inference methods for a branching process approximation which accounts for contact degree heterogeneity \cite{Burch2016}, which is relevant for such small outbreaks or the onset of a large outbreak.-->    <br></p><br>

<p class="subtitle">A new distance for graphs with absorption</p>
<p class="kjstyle"><img src="images/resTimeCentral.png" align="right"
alt="Centrality of star" height="270px">
  Standard distance measures between nodes on a graph, such as shortest path or commute
time, only consider network structure.  We develop a metric on what we call "graphs with absorption"
 that takes into account both network structure and a local node characteristic, i.e. absorption.
 This is motivated by the study of infectious disease on networks where absorption represents
  pathogen decay, viral clearance, etc.  The directed metric we define is based on a 
  generalized inverse of the graph Laplacian matrix, first introduced by Tien et al. (2015).  
We futher define a node centrality measure and develop a community
detection algorithm that account for local absorption rates as well as graph structure.  
Stochastic simulations of SIR-type disease on multi-patch community networks indicate that
our new distance and centrality metrics inform features of epidemics such as outbreak size and time until infection.<br></p><br>

<p class="kjstyle"><img src="images/CCN1.png" align="left" height="300px"
alt="OV" >
Oncolytic viruses (OV) selectively target and kill cancer cells and hold
much promise as therapuetic agents that can amplify themselves in
vivo. Yet challenges in drug development remain and therefore,
mathematical modeling may provide valuable insight. We have developed a model for treatment with a fusogenic OV which is capable of spreading via cell-to-cell fusion
within the tumor. The model is formulated as a nonlinear hyperbolic-parabolic
partial differential equations system with a moving boundary.  Main
results include proof of existence and uniqueness of solutions and
numerical investigation of the effects of viral burst size and cell
fusion rate on long-term tumor volume. Using a similar modeling framework, we have also investigated the
upregulation of the matricellular protein CCN1 in virotherapy of glioma. Overexpression of CCN1 has been shown
experimentally to induce an antiviral immune response including the
proinflammatory activation of macrophages. Model results suggest that
macrophage content is a critical factor to the success of OV therapy
and to the reduction in tumor volume gained with coadministration of a
CCN1 antibody. </p><br>

  <p class="subtitle">Cholera in Bangladesh</p>
<p class="kjstyle"><img src="images/Ganges_delta.jpg" align="right"
  alt="" height="250px">
  Cholera remains a serious public health burden in the developing
  world with global burden estimated to be 2.8 million cholera cases
  per year. Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, is an
  aquatic bacterium which is capable of living indefinitely in
  environmental water bodies outside of human hosts. Transmission is
  predominantly fecal-oral through contaminated water
						  indicating that
						  local surface water
						  and sanitary
						  conditions are
						  paramount to the
						  spread of the
						  disease.  We combine
						  hydrological
						  modeling of surface
						  waters, dynamic
						  network disease
  models and epidemiological data to investigate the seasonality of
  cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh. We aim to determine the
  hydrological and climatic drivers behind annual patterns of cholera
  in Bangladesh and the large interannual variability in disease
  severity in order to establish the most effective measures for the
  prediction and mitigation of outbreaks.<br></p><br>
